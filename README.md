# my-mesh-fusion

Making the following changes:

## 1. Scale
If the meshes are grouped and should be scaled by one of them. for example, a.ply,b.ply and c.ply. Now all of them should be scaled by c.ply. 

## 2. render 
Since it is changed to read .ply files by the package *trimesh*, so the dimension of the reading process is changed. 

## 3. fusion
Nothing changed
